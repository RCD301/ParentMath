# Quick Start Guide for Parents

Welcome to ParentMath! This tool helps you understand your child's homework so you can teach them confidently.

## What This App Does

Think of it as having an elementary school teacher in your pocket. When you don't understand your child's math homework or how to explain it, this app gives you:

- **Clear explanations** of what the problem is asking
- **Step-by-step teaching guidance** with specific phrases to use
- **Real-world examples** your child will understand (pizza slices, toys, etc.)
- **Common questions** your child might ask and how to answer them

## How to Use It (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Choose Your Mode

**"I Need Help"** (Parent Mode)
- Choose this when YOU need help understanding the problem
- You'll get coaching on how to explain it to your child
- Best for when you're confused by the "new math"

**"My Kid Needs Help"** (Kid Mode)
- Choose this when you understand it but need help explaining it
- You'll get kid-friendly explanations to read together
- Best for younger kids or visual learners

### Step 2: Enter the Problem

**Take a Photo** 📸
- Quick and easy for problems with diagrams
- Works best with clear, well-lit photos
- Tip: Hold the camera directly above the paper

**Type It In** ✏️
- Most reliable option
- Type exactly as it appears: `1/2 + 1/4`
- Works for all problem types

### Step 3: Get Your Guidance

The app will show you:
- What the problem is asking (in adult terms)
- How to explain each step
- Fun examples to use
- Common mistakes to watch for
- The answer (worked into the explanation)

## Example Problems to Try

Start with these to get a feel for the app:

1. **Simple fraction**: `1/2 + 1/4`
2. **Word problem**: `If I have 5 apples and give away 2, how many do I have left?`
3. **Multiplication**: `25 × 4`
4. **Comparison**: `Which is bigger: 2/3 or 3/4?`

## Tips for Best Results

### When to Use Photo vs. Text

**Use Photo When:**
- Problem has diagrams or pictures
- Problem has special formatting (number lines, grids)
- You're in a hurry

**Use Text When:**
- Problem is simple text
- You want the most reliable results
- Photo isn't working well

### Teaching Tips

1. **Don't just give answers** - The app shows you HOW to guide your child to discover the answer
2. **Use the real-world examples** - Kids understand "pizza slices" better than "fractions"
3. **Read the "Common Questions" section** - Be prepared for what your child might ask
4. **Stay patient** - The guidance includes encouragement phrases to use

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see my API key working"
- Make sure you added it to the `.env` file
- Restart the app after adding the key
- Check there are no extra spaces

### "Photo upload isn't working"
- Try using "Type It In" instead (more reliable)
- Make sure photo is clear and well-lit
- Check that you granted camera permission

### "The explanation seems too complex"
- Try switching to "Kid Mode" for simpler language
- Break it down into smaller steps with your child
- Focus on one concept at a time

### "I need help with advanced math"
- This app is designed for K-5 (ages 5-11) only
- For middle/high school math, try Khan Academy or photomath

## What Makes This Different

**Not like other homework apps:**
- ❌ Photomath → Gives kids quick answers (encourages cheating)
- ❌ Khan Academy → For learning new topics (not for parent coaching)
- ❌ ChatGPT → Generic AI (not designed for parent-teaching scenarios)

**This app is unique:**
- ✅ Designed specifically for parents
- ✅ Focuses on teaching, not answers
- ✅ Warm, supportive tone
- ✅ Includes the "meta" layer (what to say when they ask...)

## Privacy & Safety

- No account required
- No data stored or saved
- Each problem is analyzed fresh
- Your photos/text aren't saved anywhere
- Completely private and safe

## Got Questions?

**Q: Can I use this during homework time?**
A: Yes! Use it to prep yourself before helping your child, or use "Kid Mode" to read explanations together.

**Q: Will this make my child dependent on it?**
A: No - the app teaches YOU how to teach THEM. Your child doesn't need to use the app.

**Q: How much does it cost?**
A: The app itself is free. You just need an Anthropic API key (~$0.01-0.05 per problem).

**Q: What grades does it support?**
A: Kindergarten through 5th grade (ages 5-11)

**Q: Can I use it for homework in other subjects?**
A: No, it's specifically designed for elementary math.
